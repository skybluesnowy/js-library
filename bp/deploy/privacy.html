In addition, in connection with some activities, we collect additional personally identifiable information such as your date of birth, street and billing address and credit card number.</p>

			<p>When corresponding with you via e-mail, we may use a variety of technologies, such as 'clear gifs' or 'web beacons', to let us know, among other things, whether you received and opened our e-mail. The clear gif included in the e-mail may establish a cookie on your system that further allows us to tailor information to fit your personal interests.</p>
